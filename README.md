**Unleashing the Power of Data Monetization**
In the digital age, data is hailed as currency. It can be harnessed to generate revenue. It goes beyond the traditional view of data as a byproduct of business operations. Instead, it positions data as a strategic asset that, when correctly harnessed, can open new avenues for growth and innovation. Data Monetization has become the process of transforming data to economic value. Allowing businesses not to leave money on the table and to tap into new revenue opportunities.
According to Deloitte, the opportunity surrounding data monetization, the process of converting data and analytics into financial returns globally reached US$2.1 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to surge to US$15.5 billion by the end of the decade—a CAGR of 22.1%.1

**Transforming Data into Gold**
Data on its own has value. It is the insights derived from the data that increases its value. These insights can be used to direct activities as varied as customer segmentation, demand and churn prediction, pricing optimization, retention marketing, and cost management — and they can also command even greater margins when sold externally.
Data monetization is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor. Successful implementation requires a deep understanding of the organization's goals, data assets, and the market landscape. Whereas many tech leaders agree on the opportunities in monetizing data, their environments and data capabilities are often uncapitalized and remain basic. Organizations sit on vast reservoirs of data but lack the ability to monetize this asset as experts become alive to the reality that data monetization is not merely about the quantitative aspects of collecting and storing data; but increasingly the qualitative processes of extracting meaningful insights and intelligence that can create differentiation, competitive advantages and innovative usage scenarios to drive revenues.
