#Data Monetisation


**Unleashing the Data Potential**
In the digital age, data is hailed as currency. It can be harnessed to generate revenue. It goes beyond the traditional view of data as a byproduct of business operations. Instead, it positions data as a strategic asset that, when correctly harnessed, can open new avenues for growth and innovation. Data monetization then refers to the process of transforming data to economic value.
According to Deloitte, the opportunity surrounding data monetization, the process of converting data and analytics into financial returns globally reached US$2.1 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to surge to US$15.5 billion by the end of the decade—a CAGR of 22.1%.[1]

**Transforming Data into Gold**
Data on its own has no value. It is the insights derived from the data that increases its value. These insights can be used to direct activities as varied as customer segmentation, demand and churn prediction, pricing optimization, retention marketing, and cost management - allowing businesses not to leave money on the table and to tap into new revenue opportunities.
Data monetization is not merely about the collection and storing of data; but extracting insights that can inform competitive advantages, differentiation and innovation strategies.

According to McKinsey & Company survey, data and analytics are changing the way business is done—as well as the nature of competition—in ways such as launching new data monetization products, including analytics services.

**Not all Data is Created Equal.**
Successful data monetization requires a careful approach that focuses on the highest-value opportunities that are consistent with a company’s overall business strategy. An approach that works in one case may not necessarily be the right fit for another. What we agree on is that identification of high value data assets is a crucial first step.

**Simplifying Value Creation and Realization**
Generating revenue from data can be automated in a continuum of collecting, enriching, transforming, and deriving insights. Progressive monitoring of KPIs such as revenue generated, customer retention and user engagement can further be reincorporated into successive cycles.

 Continuous integration of the collection and performance for the sold data assets, insights, embedded data in products and services and partner ecosystems activity has the effect of compounding leverage for businesses to respond with agility to the dynamic market and operating landscapes.
 
**There are two value realization paths to data monetization.**
The first is internal and focuses on leveraging data such as customer segmentation, demographics, locales, behavior patterns, trends to improve a company’s operations, productivity, and products and services creating value through embedded unique and personalized customer experiences, products recommendations.

The second path is external and involves creating new revenue streams through collaboration with partners who may find a business’ data and insights valuable to enrich and enhance their offerings. For instance, Online taxi services can benefit from real-time traffic and weather data to optimize routes and dynamic fare pricing. Consumer and commercial use cases can benefit from subscription models which avail continuous access to a steady stream of valuable insights, dashboards and industry reports.

**Ensuring Data Privacy and Compliance**
Data monetization comes with the responsibility of safeguarding customer privacy and adhering to regulations. Implementing robust data governance practices and ensuring compliance with data protection laws not only builds trust but also mitigates the risk of legal repercussions.
